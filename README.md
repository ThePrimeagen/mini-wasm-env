When full wasms just wont due

## State of the Union
As of now this repo is purely for play.  It is not meant to be used in any
other way than to simply fork and build your toy project in.  I am extremely
new to the world of distributing c projects as is.  So lol4head.

## Goals
I have three primary goals.

1.  For me to understand some lower level concepts while creating an
    application that can realistically be used for a WebAssembly app.
2.  To exlore memory management that could potentially be used at Netflix.
3.  To be a badass
4.  Off by one problems.

## Open Source huh?
Yeah, its open source.  No, I am going to be slow to respond to any issues, if
they crop up.  But feel free to file an issue or make a PR.  I'll like accept
it if its in line.  Just don't expect white glove service here.

### You really want to contribute
Ok.  Figure out how to unit test in c, kthxbye.
